[Financial Sentiment Analysis distilbert](https://huggingface.co/nojedag/financial-sentiment-analysis-distilbert-base-uncased)

## About

This repository contains the implementation of a transformer-based model for natural language processing tasks.
## Dataset

This model was trained on the [Financial Sentiment Analysis dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbhatti/financial-sentiment-analysis) available on Kaggle. The dataset contains financial news headlines labeled with sentiment scores, which were used to fine-tune the DistilBERT model for financial sentiment classification.
